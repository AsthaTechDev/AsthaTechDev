## Day 4: #CrackYourInternship Challenge Progress [27-09-2024]

Concepts Learned:
Counting Sort: I learned how to implement Counting Sort to efficiently sort arrays with a small range of distinct elements. I applied this knowledge to solve the "Sort Colors" problem using a frequency array to count occurrences and modify the array in-place.
Problem Solved:

Implemented Counting Sort for the Sort Colors problem, which involved sorting an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s.
Takeaways:

Improved understanding of how to manipulate arrays in-place.
Strengthened skills in applying sorting algorithms like Counting Sort to real-world coding challenges.
Keep up the momentum! Let me know if you'd like to dive into other algorithms or problems.
